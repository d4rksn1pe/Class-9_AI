## Introduction
Emoji Svanger Hunt is based on CV (Computer Vision). The user is asked to find real world things which represent the emoji. It uses accessible emojis so that users can find things very easily

## Process
The computer vision uses data (pictures of the object) it is trained on and finds similarities between the object and data. If the similarities are more then it predicts the object and calls it correct. Through this game we are also training the machine with our data

## Observation
Sometimes the machine cannot guess the object even if it is correct. This is because of the lack of data training. It can be trained more and then it will be able to recognize the object

## Learning
I learned about computer vision and how can we use it in a game.

## Conclusion
CV (Computer Vision) can be utilized in different fields and activities.
