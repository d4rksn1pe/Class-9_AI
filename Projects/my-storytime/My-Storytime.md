## Introduction
My Storytime is based on natural language processing where we can make the Google assistant more personal by recording stories and then using it for children to get them to sleep while listening our own recorded stories

## Process
FIrst we record the greetings in our voice so that it becomes more personalised and a kid/child feels more comfortable listening to a voice which he/she is used to. Then we record the story and rnter the title and the author so that we can select it.

## Observation
When the audio is recorded after the processing the audioâ€™s loudness normalization and silence trimming were edited. The end result turned out to be very good.

## Learning
My Storytime uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) in making interactive and fun stories for everyone
